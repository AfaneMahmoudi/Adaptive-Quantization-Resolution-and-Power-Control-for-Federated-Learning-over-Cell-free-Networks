## 📖 Description  
This repository contains the implementation of our research on optimizing Federated Learning (FL) over **Cell-Free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) networks**.  
We propose a **co-optimized physical layer and FL framework** that mitigates the straggler effect through:  
- **Adaptive Mixed-Resolution Quantization** – Prioritizing essential gradient updates with higher precision.  
- **Dynamic Uplink Power Control** – Managing user rates for efficient communication and mitigating the straggler effect.  



## 🚀 Key Contributions  
✔️ Reduces **communication overhead by 93%** while maintaining FL accuracy.  
✔️ **75% lower overhead** and **10% higher test accuracy** than AQUILA, Top-q, and LAQ.  
✔️ Evaluated on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashion-MNIST** datasets.

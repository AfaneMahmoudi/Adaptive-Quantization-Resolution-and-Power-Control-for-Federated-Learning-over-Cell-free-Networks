# üì° Federated Learning over Cell-free massive MIMO Networks: Adaptive Quantization & Power Control  

## üìñ Description  
This repository contains the implementation of our research on optimizing Federated Learning (FL) over **Cell-Free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) networks**.  
We propose a **co-optimized physical layer and FL framework** that mitigates the straggler effect through:  
- **Adaptive Mixed-Resolution Quantization** ‚Äì Prioritizing essential gradient updates with higher precision.  
- **Dynamic Uplink Power Control** ‚Äì Managing user rates for efficient communication.

## üöÄ Key Contributions  
‚úîÔ∏è Reduces **communication overhead by 93%** while maintaining FL accuracy.  
‚úîÔ∏è **75% lower overhead** and **10% higher test accuracy** than AQUILA, Top-q, and LAQ.  
‚úîÔ∏è Evaluated on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Fashion-MNIST** datasets.
